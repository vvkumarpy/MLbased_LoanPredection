### Machine Learning based Loan Prediction with different models

### In this kernel ,I will try to show you how different models can improve just by doing simple process on the data .

### we are going to work on binary classification problem, where we got some information about sample of peoples , and
###we need to predict whether we should give some one a loan or not depending on his information . 
###we actually have a few sample size (614 rows), so we will go with machine learning techniques to solve our problem .

## what you will learn
## basics of visualizing the data .
## how to compare between feature importance (at less in this data) .

# Feature Selection &  Feature Engineer

### some simple techniques to process the data .
### handling missing data .
### how to deal with categorical and numerical data .
### outliers data detection
### but the most important thing that you will learn , is how to evaluate your model at every step you take .
### what we will use 
### some important libraries like sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy
### fill the values using backward 'bfill' method for numerical columns , and most frequent value for categorical columns (simple techniques)
### 4 different models to train your data, so we can compare between them

# a) logistic regression
# b) KNeighborsClassifier
# c) SVC
# d) DecisionTreeClassifier
